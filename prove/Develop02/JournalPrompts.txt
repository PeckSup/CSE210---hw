What would you do for a Klondike bar?
How many frogs did you kiss today?
Have you ever bathed in yogurt?
Do you look good in leggings?
Have you ever sniffed a stinkbug?
Have you ever painted daisies on a big red rubber ball?
Have you ever been to Boston in the fall?
Team Jacob or Team Edward?
Do you like me?
How many jars of mayonnaise have you injested?
